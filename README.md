# üìù Key Functionalities

-   **Add Users/Subscriptions**: Use the "Create Subscription" form to add a new user and their subscription duration.
-   **Manage Subscriptions**: View and edit existing users through the user table, where you can:
    -   Modify user details
    -   Extend subscription periods
    -   Send email reminders for upcoming expiration dates
    -   Delete users from the list
-   **Send Bulk Emails**: Navigate to the "Send Emails" section to send custom messages to multiple users at once.

## üìß Email Notifications

Ensure you have configured your Outlook email correctly via the environment variables to enable email functionality. This allows you to:

-   Notify users when their subscription is extended.
-   Send personalized reminders for expiring subscriptions.
-   Send bulk email messages to selected users.

## üìú Logging Actions

All actions taken on users, such as:

-   Adding new users
-   Modifying user details
-   Extending subscriptions
-   Deleting users

...are logged in a file for future reference. These logs will later be accessible through a dedicated page within the dashboard, allowing you to review all historical changes and interactions.
